# CultiSmart — Grow Room Controller (Temp/Humidity + Lighting)

Embedded monitoring and control system for a grow room. The system measures **temperature and humidity** and controls **lighting** (and other actuators if applicable), providing a reliable environment control solution.

## My role
Technical lead: electronics design, firmware development, and system integration.  
(Include: sensor integration, actuator control, testing, and documentation.)

## System overview
- Microcontroller-based control board
- Temperature & humidity sensing
- Lighting control (relay/MOSFET/driver stage)
- Optional: connectivity/telemetry (Wi-Fi / dashboard) if used

## Key features
- Periodic sensor acquisition with basic validation
- Configurable control rules (thresholds / schedules)
- Designed for maintainability: modular firmware + clear wiring

## Evidence
- Photos/videos: `/media`
- Schematics/PCB files: `/hardware`
- Report and documentation: `/docs`

## Repository structure (recommended)
- `/firmware`
- `/hardware`
- `/docs`
- `/media`
